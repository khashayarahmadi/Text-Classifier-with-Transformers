# Advanced Spam Detection for Safer Digital Communication

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an advanced spam detection system developed as part of a Bachelor of Science thesis at Zand Institute of Higher Education. The project, titled *"Creating a Safer Space with Advanced Spam Detection"*, focuses on leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to build a robust email spam classifier. By utilizing state-of-the-art transformer models from the Hugging Face library, the system achieves an impressive accuracy of 99% in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails.

The primary goal is to enhance email security, reduce false positives, and improve user trust in digital communication by providing an efficient and adaptive spam detection tool.

## Objectives
- **Understand User Needs**: Incorporate user feedback to create a human-centered spam detection solution.
- **Analyze Spam Patterns**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover characteristics of spam and legitimate messages.
- **Develop Advanced Models**: Implement transformer-based machine learning models for accurate spam classification.
- **Ensure User-Centric Design**: Create intuitive and reliable tools to enhance user experience.
- **Achieve High Accuracy**: Target a 99% accuracy rate in spam detection while minimizing false positives.

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach to develop and evaluate the spam detection system:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - A diverse dataset of labeled spam and non-spam emails was sourced from publicly available repositories.
   - Web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup were employed to gather additional user-generated content.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - HTML tags and irrelevant content were removed using BeautifulSoup.
   - Text normalization, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization were applied to enhance data quality.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) from the Hugging Face library were fine-tuned for spam detection.
   - Hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation ensured optimal model performance.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) were calculated, achieving a 99% accuracy rate.
   - Validation loss and training metrics were monitored to minimize overfitting.

5. **Results**:
   - The model demonstrated rapid learning, with accuracy improving from 96.84% in epoch 1 to 99% by epoch 4.
   - Low validation loss indicated strong generalization to unseen data.

## Usage
1. **Explore the Notebook**:
   - The main implementation is available in the Colab notebook: [Spam Detection Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12xWeAJdP4Y8zwa0aJJBjBv6CJppzMU3?usp=sharing).
   - The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Update file paths in the scripts/notebook as needed.
   - Run the notebook or scripts to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Results
The model achieved a 99% accuracy rate after five epochs, with the following metrics:

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss | Accuracy  |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1     | 0.205700      | 0.173406        | 96.84%    |
| 2     | 0.075500      | 0.035889        | 98.68%    |
| 3     | 0.040800      | 0.129998        | 97.63%    |
| 4     | 0.073000      | 0.037181        | 98.95%    |
| 5     | 0.021900      | 0.041958        | 98.68%    |

The low validation loss and high accuracy demonstrate the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

## Recommendations
- **Continuous Retraining**: Regularly update the model with new spam samples to adapt to evolving tactics.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Include multilingual and multi-platform spam data for broader applicability.
- **Collaborations**: Partner with email providers to integrate the model into real-time filtering systems.
- **Privacy Focus**: Ensure ethical data practices and transparency in model deployment.
